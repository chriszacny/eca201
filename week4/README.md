## Week 4 :dolphin:

> In week 4 we'll reincarnate the openpyxl application, and begin knitting four weeks worth of programming into a useful application. Half way! You're leaving the mystery and magic of ojbect oriented programming behind and becoming capable of the basics. Continue doing the `python_koans` to add more tools to your toolbelt. 
> `openpyxl` makes excel accessible to scripting, pipelining, and transforming raw data in workbooks. Imagination is the limit for how to use the library, but we'll use it somewhat academically at first to get OOP more cleary defined and practiced.
